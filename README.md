plottage
========

plottage is where I'm incrementally dumping a variety of cleaned-up visualization tools I've written in the past. This first iteration just contains multiplot and graphucius.

multiplot displays one or more series in a single 2D figure. It tries to make it easy to distinguish between series by using different colors and point markers. matplotlib is required.

graphucius is a class that can be used to generate a DOT representation of weighted directed graph. You can use graphviz to turn this into an image.

If you find plottage useful or have a suggestion for new tool or killer feature, let me know! jolly@cs.wisc.edu
